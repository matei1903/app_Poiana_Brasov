# app_Poiana_Brasov

A personal project made for Web Technologies class in college. It's an interactive app where its users can create an account and see details and informations about all the ski slopes and weather forecast. The app can evolve in a more complex application with more uses such as buying tickets or make subscriptions for the teleski or access cards for the slopes.
